CombineRepo
===========

CombineRepo is a graphical tool to merge more git repositories. Actually is still in alpha test. Unfortunately cannot process correctly
repository with more than one open branch.... I' working to improve preformances and solve this problem.
Software is tested with msysgit 1.7.3.1

To compile both software you need Delphi XE7 professional and [SmartInspect](www.smartinspect.com)

To use yo need to add repository with the Add button, then use an empty directory in destination repo and start
the program. This program don't need to be installed just copy exefile.... It should discover Git installation automatically
